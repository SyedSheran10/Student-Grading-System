# Student-Grading-System
The provided C++ program allows the user to input a student's name, the number of grades, and the grades themselves. It then calculates the average grade, as well as the highest and lowest grades, and displays the results. The program uses dynamic memory allocation to create an array for the grades, and it includes error handling for invalid marks.

This program provides a simple and functional way to manage student grades using dynamic memory allocation. It ensures that the memory allocated for the grades is properly deallocated using the `delete[]` operator to prevent memory leaks.
